# Game Development Tools Job Roles

Learn game development tool job roles.

## Level Designer

They use game engines to create dynamic and immersive levels, challenges, and missions. They research gameplay
specifications and implement details—actions, events, objects, and environments—into the game. To keep players focused
and engaged, they envision themselves in the player's position and map out all possibilities, considering logic, action
sequences, and conditions for triggering events.

## Tools Engineer

They enhance the workflow of game developers by providing optimal tools. They modify or create tools to support game
development, collaborating with programmers, artists, and designers to determine needs, explain tool usage, and assess
effectiveness.
Custom tools developed by Tools Engineers streamline various tasks, such as:

* Converting assets like 3D models and textures into game-compatible formats.
* Transferring assets from game engines to 3D applications like Blender or graphic editors like Photoshop.
* Writing scripts to build new game versions automatically during development.

The work of a Tools Engineer varies daily based on the changing needs of game developers.

## Engine Programmer

When existing game engines fall short of the development team's vision, Engine Programmers build a customized base
engine. They repurpose popular game engines, adding new features and rewriting existing functionality to enhance
efficiency.

## More Roles

Nearly every role in game development relies on tools to accomplish tasks. Notable roles include:

* **Artists:** Animators, character artists, and modelers use tools to bring their visions to life in 2D and 3D.
* **Localization Specialists:** They translate in-game text, voice scripts, manuals, and other documents into multiple
  languages.
* **Publishers:** Game developers collaborate with them for financial support and distribution, ensuring the game
  develops on budget and schedule.
