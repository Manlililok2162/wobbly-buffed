## Creative Director üé•

Also known as the lead game designer, they decide how a game looks and the gameplay experience. Along with other lead
roles, they make critical decisions that shape the overall look and feel of the game, such as the genre or elements that
best fit the storyline or mechanics. Moreover, they ensure the project meets its deadlines and budget constraints during
development, making necessary adjustments. One must possess skills in project management and a foundation in various
video game development disciplines to succeed.

## Concept Artist üñºÔ∏è

They manually or digitally design, draw, and sketch game elements (e.g., objects, characters, environments). Their work
shapes the game's mood and storyline. They may collaborate with the creative director and other designers to identify
the necessary sketches for each game level or scene.

They may research to reference objects and characters for sketches, creating multiple revisions until meeting
specifications. Those who have a background in art of graphic design and knowledge of design software may excel.

## Game Marketer üìà

They target the game to the proper demographic by showcasing its storyline, look, feel, and design elements to boost
sales. Moreover, they promote the game on social media, create and place advertisements for maximum visibility, and
engage influencers for promotional contracts. This process often begins early in development to represent accurately the
game's main themes and selling points.
