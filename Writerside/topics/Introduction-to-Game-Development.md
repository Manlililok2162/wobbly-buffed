# Introduction to Game Development

## What is Game Development?

Video games started with 8-bit ones created by small teams or one person. Today, teams work on different video games the
whole year since consumers expect these games to immerse them in their stories and gameplay through blockbuster-quality
audio and visuals. Even so, smaller teams can still make quality games compared to before.
